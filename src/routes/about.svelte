	<p>The mission of ESG Impact is to democratize ESG for private markets.</p>
	<p>
		We provide accessible and pragmatic frameworks for companies and funds to assess and address ESG
		metrics most material to their operations. We believe that business ethics should not be
		transactional or cost a fortune. We understand that 'greenwashing' is the result of pushing ESG
		too far, using the complexity and myriad of frameworks as a means for confusion instead of a
		call for unified core metrics.
	</p>

	<p>
		Our core values are: <span class='text-primary'>Quality</span>, doing things extraordinarily well or not at all; <span class='text-primary'>Inspiration</span>,
		uplifting ourselves and our peers; <span class='text-primary'>Diversity</span>, reaping the benefits of having different
		perspectives; and <span class='text-primary'>Transparency</span>, being authentic in action and displaying a boldness to unveil
		the truth. We have decided on these not for their encompassment of ethics, but for the
		applicability to our business operations and dynamisms of our founding team.
