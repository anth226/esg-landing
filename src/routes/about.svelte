					<div>The mission of ESG Impact is to democratize ESG & Impact for private markets.</div>
					<div class="mt-6">
						We provide accessible and pragmatic solutions for companies and funds to assess and
						address ESG metrics most salient to their operations. We believe that business ethics
						should not be transactional or cost a fortune. We understand that greenwashing is the
						result of pushing ESG too far, using the complexity and myriad of frameworks as a means
						for profitable confusion instead of a call for unification.
					</div>
					<div class="mt-6 ">
						Our core values are: <span class="text-primary font-bold">Quality</span>, doing things
						extraordinarily well or not at all;
						<span class="text-primary font-bold">Inspiration</span>, uplifting ourselves and our
						peers; <span class="text-primary font-bold">Diversity</span>, reaping the benefits of
						having different perspectives; and
						<span class="text-primary font-bold">Transparency</span>, being authentic in action and
						displaying a boldness to unveil the truth. We have decided on these not for their
						encompassment of ethics, but for the applicability to our business operations and
						dynamisms of our founding team.
