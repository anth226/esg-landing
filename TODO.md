## Note: Im still finalizing the content so don't worry if some of the sentences look dumb haha.

## 1. Homepage

- Create the front-end for the section beneath the partner logos. (I sent the PDF mockup on slack)
- I'd like the timeline on the left to be programmaticly done if possible. Showing from 2020 to 2030, 5 years at a time, 5 projects (add one more project than shown). The user could then drag through the timeline and lock/snap to a year. Use your best judgement here-- if you need a gantt or chart package / if it's too hard to do and an image would be better / if you have any UI/UX suggestions for it. I'm excited to see what you come up with.

## 2. Pricing âœ…

- Add 4 new 'fund' cards on the toggle. Also add a transition that fits and change the gold/bold for the toggle label. I'll fill in the content
- fix mobile compatibility

## 3. Fade transition between all pages

## 4. Footer

- static/examples/footer-example.png
- from https://www.officespacesoftware.com/
- Recreate this look (the top three grids, not the bottom illustration), and I can fill in the content

## 5. Header / Pages

- Remove the Software page and add Homepage in it's place (which is the '/' or main page).
- Add a css/ui change to the header so the user knows which page they are on. Just an underline or color change will do for now, I can play around with this on my own.
