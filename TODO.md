## Note: I changed the 'base-100' color to be #fff white and added the #113345 navy blue as 'secondary'

## 1. Fix fading between pages. It could just be Svelte, or my dev environment, but clicking on a new page 1) instantly shows new page 2) fades 3) shows new page again. Instead of 1) fades 2) shows new page

## 2. Fix weird scrolling issue on pricing-- when toggling companies and funds. The responsiveness of the height of the container div for the new cards coming in and out

## 3. Add a header that fades/tranlates in once your scroll past a certain px. An example of this animation is:

slack.com

## 4. Add a modal to each person's picture in About Us:

One modal I found:
https://tailwindui.com/components/application-ui/overlays/modals

## 5. For the next section on the homepage, 'The ESG Impact Process', re-create the look on static/examples/example.png with the five clickable buttons on the left.

The example is from novisto.com

I can transform the pictures to that perspective unless you know how to with the perscpective() css thing. Just use filler images for now and I can change them later.

## 6. For the Timeline, have different projects throughout the various years at different translateX's. If it's easier to do, maybe have the projects move/snap along with the scroll? (instead of fade in/out)

Here are some exmaple projects:

ESG Baseline
Procurement
SOC 2 Certification
Scope 1 & 2 GHG
Scope 3 GHG
DEI Policy
Employee Handbook
Fair Wage Analysis
Hazardous Waste Policy
Local Community Engagement
Remote Working Policy
Security Control Certification
Disaster Rocovery Process
Impact Analysis
Benchmark Analysis
Stakeholder Surveys
