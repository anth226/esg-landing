1. Center the 'Request a Demo' section on the footer (vertically). Increase the gap horizontally between them a little

2. Can each 'schedule a demo' & 'get started' button send the user to a contact page (not on the menu) with their email already filled in from the previous input? See my mockup for a /contact route.

3. Hook up the contact page with our sendgrid account. Have it send just a basic email template for now and I can create the html for it later. Also, is there some spam check we can implement either in sendgrid or on the site? Starting with not allowing any common domain emails (gmail, outlook, icloud, yahoo, etc), and then something for ddos? Also, would best practice be to track these in our database (noSQL MongoDB)?

let me know and I will send the code

3. For the solutions table, can you make each item on the list on the left have it's own table descriptions (needs & solutions, so 8 total for each). Active item will have the primary border color underneath (same as hover). I will fill in specific content later.
