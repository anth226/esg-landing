Site looks FANTASTIC so far. Really love this.

## 1. ✅

Remove the right click drag on the globe.

## 2. ✅

I apologize for not being clear before. Let's keep the fallback image for the globe & have the preloader. The preloader will be a set # of seconds rather than an await function. Right now the preloader gif is choppy, hopefully this will fix that issue.

## 3.

Let me know of any general performace suggestions you have, even if it means getting rid of something (ie, globe hdri, planes, particles, rings, the onClickOnly function). In my opinion, particles would be the first to go (it could just be some static png background with the stars), but I think there are a few parts of the globe that are a lot more intensive.
